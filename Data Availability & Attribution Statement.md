# Data Availability & Attribution Statement (SynTwin)

This repository includes (or may include) third-party datasets that are used to **fit and validate the Host Equivalent Model (HEM)** component of SynTwin and to reproduce figures/results reported in the associated publication and Supplementary Information.

The goal of this statement is to (i) document **where each dataset comes from**, (ii) clarify how it is **used within SynTwin**, and (iii) provide the **recommended attribution**.

## Included third-party datasets (as provided in this repository)

### 1) Chure & Cremer (Flux Parity) datasets (CSV provided as Excel copies)

For reproducibility, SynTwin ships Excel copies (converted from CSV) of two datasets originally distributed with the **Chure & Cremer** work (Flux Parity repository):

- `ecoli_ribosomal_mass_fractions.csv`  
  Collated measurements of *E. coli* ribosomal mass fractions.

- `ecoli_peptide_elongation_rates.csv`  
  Collated measurements of *E. coli* peptide elongation / translation rates.

**Original source and availability (as stated by the authors):**

- GitHub repository: `https://github.com/cremerlab/flux_parity`  
  (specific files are under `data/main_figure_data/`)

- Zenodo archive DOI: `https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5893799`

In SynTwin, these datasets are used in scripts associated with **HEM parameter fitting** (e.g., fitting relationships between growth rate, ribosomal allocation, and translation capacity), as described in the paper and Supplementary Information.

**How SynTwin stores them:**

- The repository may include **Excel (.xlsx)** versions of the above CSV files to make them easier to inspect and to keep the exact values used in the workflow.
- These Excel files are **verbatim re-encodings** of the original CSV content (no reanalysis intended by the file format change).

**Attribution request:**

If you reuse these data (directly or indirectly) in analyses derived from this repository, please cite:

- the corresponding Chure & Cremer paper, and
- the Zenodo record: `10.5281/zenodo.5893799`,

and/or the Flux Parity GitHub repository, as appropriate for your venue.

## Additional upstream sources referenced by the included datasets

### 2) Bremer & Dennis (EcoSal Plus, 2008)

The Chure & Cremer collated datasets include measurements drawn from earlier literature. In particular, the supplementary materials and/or scripts associated with HEM fitting reference the classic dataset:

- Bremer, H., and Dennis, P. P. (2008).  
  *Modulation of chemical composition and other parameters of the cell at different exponential growth rates.*  
  EcoSal Plus, 3. DOI: `10.1128/ecosal.5.2.3`

Some SynTwin scripts associated with cell mass / host parameter fitting may also use values extracted from this work (as described in the Supplementary Information).

**Attribution request:**

If your analysis uses values originating from Bremer & Dennis (directly or via the Chure & Cremer compilation), please cite Bremer & Dennis (2008) in addition to the Chure & Cremer dataset source.

## License / terms

- SynTwin does not claim ownership of third-party datasets.
- Any reuse should comply with the **license/terms** of the original sources (GitHub repository, Zenodo record, and/or the original publications).
- If your journal requires explicit dataset citation, include both the Zenodo DOI and the originating publication(s).

## What SynTwin authors contribute vs. what is external

- **External**: the collated measurements (e.g., ribosomal mass fractions, peptide elongation rates) obtained from the above sources.
- **SynTwin**: processing scripts, parameter fitting routines (HEM), model code, and any derived parameter values produced by the SynTwin workflow.

Derived parameters and model fits are generated by SynTwin code and can be reproduced using the scripts and the included copies of the datasets.

## How to find the files in this repository

Depending on the distribution layout, the Excel copies may be stored under a folder such as:

- `Generate_HEM/` (or a dedicated `External_Data/` or `Experimental_Data/` subfolder)

Search for filenames containing:

- `ecoli_ribosomal_mass_fractions`
- `ecoli_peptide_elongation_rates`

## Third-Party Software

SynTwin interfaces with and/or redistributes third-party optimization software packages used for parameter estimation:

- **MEIGO (eSS – Enhanced Scatter Search)**  
  Global optimization toolbox originally developed by Egea et al.

- **BADS (Bayesian Adaptive Direct Search)**  
  Optimization algorithm developed by Acerbi & Ma.

These software packages retain their original authorship and licenses.  
Users are responsible for complying with the corresponding license terms when using or redistributing these tools.

If results obtained with SynTwin rely on these optimizers, users are encouraged to cite the original publications associated with MEIGO and/or BADS, in addition to citing the SynTwin paper.
